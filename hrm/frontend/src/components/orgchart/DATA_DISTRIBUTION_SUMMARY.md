# Data Distribution Update

## ✅ Requirement Implemented
**"Distribute Level 6 employees equally among all Level 5 managers"**

## Changes Applied
- **Source**: 251 Level 6 "Staff" employees.
- **Target**: 8 Level 5 "Senior Staff" managers.
- **Action**: Evenly distributed all 251 staff members across the 8 managers.
- **Result**: Each Level 5 manager now has approximately **31 direct reports**.

## Previous Issue
- Only some managers (like Sarah Dewns) had reports.
- Now **ALL 8 Level 5 managers** have equal teams.

## How to Verify
1.  **Refresh** the page.
2.  Select **"Level 1-6"** or **"All Levels"**.
3.  Expand **Sarah Dewns** -> See ~31 staff.
4.  Expand **any other Senior Staff** (e.g. "Senior Engineering Specialist", etc.) -> See ~31 staff.
5.  All Level 5 managers will now show the vertical list of reportees.
