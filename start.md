# SESSION START INSTRUCTIONS

When user says "start session" or any trigger phrase:

1. Read `bootstrap\00_bootstrap_master_index.md`
2. Read all the documents listed in the master index
3. Submit comprehensive understanding report
4. List tasks as per `bootstrap\06_01_next_session_plan.md`
5. Say "Ready for the tasks"

That's it. Simple and direct.
