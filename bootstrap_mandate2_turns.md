Try 2
AGENT RELIABILITY DIAGNOSTIC — 3-TURN TEST (DO NOT DEVIATE)

You must follow ALL instructions precisely. This is a compliance test.

====================================================
TURN 1 — ENVIRONMENT DISCIPLINE TEST
====================================================

Task:
Run Django system check.

You MUST output the command exactly in this format:
    cd /d D:\platform\hrm\backend && python manage.py check

Rules:
- Do NOT use semicolons (;)
- Do NOT use Push-Location / Pop-Location
- Do NOT use ls, pwd, ./manage.py
- Do NOT invent paths
- Do NOT execute anything before showing the exact command

If you use any other command style, you FAIL.

====================================================
TURN 2 — GOVERNANCE MEMORY TEST
====================================================

Answer this clearly:

What bootstrap files must be read before proceeding with any task?

Your answer must explicitly mention at least:
- bootstrap/00_bootstrap_master_index.md
- bootstrap/06_03_tasks.md
- bootstrap/06_04_tracker.md

No vague answers allowed.
No invented files allowed.

====================================================
TURN 3 — SCOPE DISCIPLINE TEST
====================================================

Answer this clearly:

For Task 02.1 Employee Records, should you rewrite/simplify the existing UI and forms?

The ONLY correct answer is:
- No. Enhance only. Preserve all components, complexity, behavior, and features.

If you suggest refactor, rewrite, simplify, redesign, or improve structure → you FAIL.

====================================================
EVALUATION RULE
====================================================

If you fail ANY section above, you must respond with:
"I am not suitable for governed execution."

If you pass all three, proceed with normal task execution.

Do not add explanations.
Do not add opinions.
Do not change format.
