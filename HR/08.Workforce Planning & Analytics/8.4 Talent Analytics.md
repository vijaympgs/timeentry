## 8.4.7 Reporting Views

```sql
View: vw_acquisition_metrics AS
SELECT
  source_channel,
  COUNT(*) AS applications,
  AVG(DATEDIFF(day, application_date, hire_date)) AS avg_time_to_fill,
  SUM(cost) / COUNT(*) AS cost_per_hire,
  AVG(quality_score) AS avg_quality_score
FROM talent_acquisition
GROUP BY source_channel;
```

## 8.4.8 Workflow & Approvals

1. **Data Ingestion** – Automated feeds from ATS, LMS, and HRIS populate the analytics tables.
2. **Data Validation** – Routine checks for completeness, consistency, and outlier detection.

| **Cost‑per‑Hire** | Avg. recruitment cost per new hire | ≤ $5,000 |
| **Quality‑of‑Hire** | Avg. performance rating after 12 months | ≥ 4.0/5 |
| **Learning Completion Rate** | % of assigned learning paths completed | ≥ 85 % |
| **Attrition Risk Accuracy** | % of predicted attritions that occur | ≥ 80 % |
| **Diversity Representation** | % of under‑represented groups in Meet or exceed target benchmarks |

## 8.4.10 Best Practices

- **Unified Data Model** – Consolidate talent data from ATS, LMS, and HRIS into a single schema.
- **Predictive Modeling** – Use machine‑learning models to forecast attrition and hiring needs.
- **Closed‑Loop Feedback** – Tie talent analytics insights to concrete HR actions and measure outcomes.
- **Data Governance** – Ensure data quality, lineage, and compliance with privacy regulations.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration** – Involve hiring managers, learning leaders, and DEI officers in metric definition and interpretation.

## 8.4.11 Governance & Compliance

- **Owner**: Talent Analytics Lead (user reference)
