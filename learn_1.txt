Where do you use Python?
Do you remember Battlefield 2, Battlefield 2142 and Battlefield Heroes - strategy and first person shooter games from EA DICE? All the games use Python for logic and server controls. Python is frequently used for creating open-source, free games, e.g., OpenRTS, PySol, Metin 2, or Frets On Fire - famous Guitar Hero-like games written in pygame.

And what about the major websites and services? Dropbox? UBER? Spotify? Pintrest? BuzzFeed? Yes. They were all written, to a greater or lesser extent, in Python. Other examples?

Internet Applications (BitTorrent, Jogger Publishing Assistant, TheCircle, TwistedMatrix)
3D CAD/CAM (FreeCAD, Fandango, Blender, Vintech RCAM)
Enterprise Applications (Odoo, Tryton, Picalo, LinOTP 2, RESTx)
Image Applications (Gnofract 4D, Gogh, imgSeek, MayaVi, VPython)
Mobile Applications (Aarlogic C05/3, AppBackup, Pyroute)
Office Applications (calibre, faces, Notalon, pyspread)
Personal Information Managers (BitPim, Narval, Prioritise, Task Coach, WikidPad)

Generally, Python is a great choice for:

Web and Internet development (e.g., Django and Pyramid frameworks, Flask and Bottle micro-frameworks)
Scientific and numeric computing (e.g., SciPy - a collection of packages for the purposes of mathematics, science, and engineering; Ipython - an interactive shell that features editing and recording of work sessions)
Education (it's a brilliant language for teaching programming! And that's why we're offering this course to you!)
Desktop GUIs (e.g., wxWidgets, Kivy, Qt)
Software Development (build control, management, and testing - Scons, Buildbot, Apache Gump, Roundup, Trac)
Business applications (ERP and e-commerce systems - Odoo, Tryton)
(Source: https://www.python.org/about/apps)
And many, many other projects and development tools.

Compiler : Advantages
•	the execution of the translated code is usually faster;
•	only the user has to have the compiler - the end-user may use the code without it;
•	the translated code is stored using machine language - as it is very hard to understand it, 
•	your own inventions and programming tricks are likely to remain your secret.

Compiler : Dis-Advantages
•	the compilation itself may be a very time-consuming process - you may not be able to run 
	your code immediately after making an amendment;
•	you have to have as many compilers as hardware platforms you want your code to be run on.

Interpreter : Advantages
•	you can run the code as soon as you complete it - there are no additional phases of translation;
•	the code is stored using programming language, not machine language - this means that it can be run on 
	computers using different machine languages; you don't compile your code separately for each different architecture.

Interpreter : Dis-Advantages
•	don't expect interpretation to ramp up your code to high speed - your code will share the computer's power with the interpreter, 
	so it can't be really fast;
•	both you and the end user have to have the interpreter to run your code.
